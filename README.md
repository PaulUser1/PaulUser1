- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulUser1
- 👀 I’m interested in Windows desktop app programming, restoring antique radios and ham radio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VB.Net, finally transitioning from a long career with VB6.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing.  I'm 77 years old and programming is my hobby that I enjoy alone.
